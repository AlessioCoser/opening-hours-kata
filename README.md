# opening-hours-kata

Amy and Valerie, the shop owners, need you to develop a simple program that satisfies the following requirements:


- The opening days of the shop need to be configurable, and can be scattered in the week (e.g. Mon, Wed, Fri)
- Amy needs to display the date of the next opening on a billboard outside of the shop
- Amy also wants to display on the website of the shop whether it is opened or closed at the moment

Write a small module that follows this contract, so that Valerie can easily integrate it:

```
OpeningHours.isOpen(date)
OpeningHours.nextOpeningDate(date)
```

Choose whatever language you like. (PS: Valerie likes Haskell and Elixir).
